# Smart Cards

This is a project that I created as I was learning the MEAN stack (neglecting Angular) and wanting to flex my creative muscles instead of just having my nose in books or videos. Because of such, the code is very messy and I no longer maintain it. 

For example, the seed.js functionalies are poorly written and are completely broken as of the last refactor. Some of the front-end js is commented, but most of the CSS is no very organized.

I might recycle the apps idea later, but if I do so, I will probably start from scratch, only using this project as a reference to see how I wrote past code.

### App Idea

The idea behind the app was to create smart queue cards that would reorganize themselves as to only be displayed on certain study days. The cards wouls be reorganized wether the user believes it has been well answered or poorly answered. Cards that have been poorly answered would be displayed the next day, so the user could promptly study them again, but cards with a good answer would be displayed at a later date. The more consecutive answers given, the later the date.

### Motivation

My motivation for the app was my own poor memory capabilities. I've always been good a solving logic puzzles and complex mathematical problems, but I've also always been limited by the contents of my head. I wanted to create a tool that would help me inject the notions I wanted into my brain without having to study them all an hour every day. My motivation stays alive, which is why I will most likely revisit the idea as a more experienced software developper... just after burning this project to the ground of course.

For the time being, I will be working on a small bar inventory application with a friend (project will also be posted on Github)
